# Alien Game
**Srikanth Schelbert**

## Goal
This was a personal coding project to create a "space invaders" like game as a part of a book where I taught myself python. It keeps track of the following items:
- Number of lives left (there are 3 ships)
- Alien point values (they increase with each level passed)
- Alien speed (increases throughout levels)
- Highest score per session

## Quick Start
To play the game, simply clone the repository and run `alien_invasion.py` as an executable. Ensure that you have a version of python3, and that Pygame is installed on your machine. 

To make the game fullscreen, simply read the docstring in the file to make the game appear fullscreen upon bringup.
